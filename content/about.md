# Miles - M 2X 

The first anime I ever watched,  [Rosario + Vampire](https://anidb.net/anime/5273), was odd one to begin with for sure. The next anime I watched, the anime that truly
 set me down this path, was [Sword Art Online](https://anidb.net/anime/5273). I was instantly hooked, I had never seen anything like it. This was back when the second
 season had just started airing. That summer, I binged all of the anime I could find online (I didn't have a clue that there were *other* ways of watching anime). There are very few of those anime that I still think of fondly at this
 point, but I don't regret watching them. It was a poor introduction, but an introduction nonetheless.
