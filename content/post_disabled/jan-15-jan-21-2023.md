## [Back to the Kassan](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/4a8zcg1/back-to-the-kaasan) (2017)

Read #2. It's been about four years since I first read this and it is still one of the strangest pieces of media I have ever experienced. Not a week has gone by without me thinking about it. Interesting note, turns out the mangaka is also the guy who makes the exhibitionist armpit fetish manga.

Youji Kuri. His first work. I'm not a fan of this one, but it's worth watching just for it's place in history.
