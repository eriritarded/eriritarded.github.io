# Preface

This is a log I kept from October of 2022 to January of 2024. Most of the time I didn't have much that was worth putting down, but the goal was to write any particularly strong feelings or thoughts I had. Odd things, things I liked, things I disliked, and anything else. Reverse order, with the most recent at the top. It's a shame I gave up on it so quick.

## [The Harmonic Gleam Vibration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12lJlDmSSW4) (2005)

Gorgeous short. Tryptamine flashbacks.

## [Uchuu Majin Daikengo](https://anidb.net/anime/3151) (1978)
Once again surprised by how much I enjoy these old, forgotten robot shows. The story is fairly mediocre, however there are quite a few great episodes. The final act was awesome. Now for complaints. The show looks ugly as hell. There is no blood shown yet there is still death, which I find odd. The main girl has an extremely sexualized design, complete with a random wardrobe malfunction. So why no blood? Very odd. The mechanical designs didn't do much for me. Ryger's design rocked. Roboleon and Baracross had a hilarious relationship, probably my favorite aspect of Daikengo.

## [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/) (2022)
The movie is fine but I do not understand the extreme praise. It was /fine/. I just don't care. This doesn't speak to me.

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive](https://anidb.net/anime/14690) (2020)
Better than most isekai and most gacha game adaptations. Nice animation. Starts out average but picks up towards the end.

<br>

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2](https://anidb.net/anime/15690) (2022)
Considering the first season started out as a shitty KonoSuba I am incredibly impressed with where it ended. The story is getting interesting. The animation is top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and hope for more seasons.

## [JAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-nSeJ6yuX8) (2009)
Brilliant animation.

<br>

---

## [Isekai Quartet: Another World](https://anidb.net/anime/15481) (2022)
Not a fan. Huge step down from the series in humor. The story was boring. Why did Vera need to be from Tanya's world? I was very bothered by the presentation of Tanya. As a huge fan of the novels, this Tanya is simply a different character.

<br>

## [xx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmNa7Bv6qRU&t=1s) (2012)
Excellent art, however I didn't really get it. Something about the red string of fate I guess.

# December 22

## [1917](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8579674/) (2019)
<!--more-->

Oppressive atmosphere. Wonderfully executed.

<br>

## [What Happens Inside the Dungeon](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/ugwe6g1/what-happens-inside-the-dungeon) (2019)
Usually K-Porn manga sucks. This one was really fun.

<br>

---

## [Venus Senki](https://anidb.net/anime/620) (1989)
The plot is nothing special. But that's not why one watches this movie. One watches it because it's gorgeous. I adore the wonderfully animated mechanical gore.
 
<br>

---

## [Pokemon: Twilight Wings](https://anidb.net/anime/15309) (2020)
I played maybe 45 minutes of Pokemon in my life and I've watched no more than 5 episodes as a kid. But I had to watch this one because Nessa is just that cute. Giving me jungle fever. Fun, sweet, self contained-stories. Enjoyable & heartwarming. 

<br>

## [Aru Asa Dummy Head Mike ni Natte Ita Ore-kun no Jinsei](https://anidb.net/anime/17513)
What the fuck did I just watch?

<br>

---

## [Shinmai Renkinjutsushi no Tenpo Keiei](https://anidb.net/anime/16732) (2022)
<!--more-->

Atelier Ryza anime before Atelier Ryza anime. One of those cute girls doing jack shit in a fantasy world series that I just adore.

<br>

---


## [Greed](https://anidb.net/anime/2493) (1985)
A very early OVA. All style no substance. Reminds me a lot of [Birth](https://anidb.net/anime/2640) (albeit not as cool) - the story is just a device to show some pretty visuals, a ton of chase scenes, and all the weird moving camera angles. I enjoyed it enough for what it was.

<br>

---

## [Akiba Meido Sensou](https://anidb.net/anime/17475) (2022)
 Surprisingly good for an anime about ganbanger maids.
 
<br>

---

## [Elf Princess Rane](https://anidb.net/anime/151) (1995)
Just plain awful. Utter dogshit. I assume this is a parody, because it is mind-numbingly stupid. In a very bad way. Not engaging in the slightest. The plot makes so little sense that I can't tell you anything that happened the whole hour. 
There's a character that says words backwards, and multiple occurrences of multiple characters talking over each other at a fast pace. 
There's good slapstick and there's bad slapstick. This is unequivocally the latter. I didn't even grin once. Worthless. I don't understand who the intended audience would have been.

<br>

## [00:08](https://anidb.net/anime/11391)
An anxiety inducing [short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcPGyvciRz0).

<br>

---

## [Bocchi the Rock!](https://anidb.net/anime/16063) (2022)
Near perfect. Almost feels like a golden era Doga Kobo show. Easily up there with the best CGDCT. Sequal when?

<br>

---

## [Spy x Family Part 2](https://anidb.net/anime/17061) (2022)
Decent show. But why did they start naming anime like this? Please die.

<br>

## [Super Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross](https://anidb.net/anime/1177) (1984)
<!--more-->

Lana. Lana Lana Lana Lana Lana. Lanaaaaaaaaaaa. I love Lana. Lana Lana Lana. Lana so cute. Lana is such a pretty name. Lana is so perfect. Lana. ARA ARA LANA. Lana are you looking to get married? Oh Lana, oh Lana. I have GOTTA get arrested by the military police. Please. Help me commit war crimes. Thanks.
Anyways. This anime seemed quite derivative. Seen most of the ideas in older mecha anime. Draws some from its older Super Dimensional Sister, Macross. Similar to [Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) in MANY ways, so much so that I'm convinced it's where the ideas came from. 
I had a lot to say while watching it. Now? Not much, just dissatisfaction. I did not get much out of this one. Started out good & the funny Squad 15 hijinks were good, but then a certain character was introduced. 
That guy sucks! Having a female protaganist in such an old mecha is nice, even if I didn't care much for her design or personality. The other characters were shallow. The plot? Just watch ideon. Or don't. 
It's not like they're the same exact shows, but Ideon did what I think Southern Cross tried to do so much better. Not to mention that Ideon was 2 years earlier. Funny how both MCs have afros! 

<br>

## [Ginga Reppuu Baxingar](https://anidb.net/anime/3116) (1982)
<!--more-->
Part 2 of the J9 trilogy. Comes with even better music. The opening is /unbelievably/ hype. Awful in just about every other aspect. 
At least it tries, and it tries hard. It really is a shame that Baxingar is just not that good of a show. There is so much gold but the execution was poor. 
Every death is telegraphed as soon as the character is introduced. There is no sense of time. I couldn't tell you if this anime took place over the course of 2 weeks or 2 years. 
I get that this is an old foreign cartoon with space motorcycles that grow enormous and then transform into a magical space robot. 
But I think it should still make sense within the world of Baxingar. All that said, I would be lying if I said I didn't like this a lot.

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars](https://anidb.net/anime/1307) (1988)
Watch #2. An amazing introduction.

<br>

## [Saltiness](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/u7x5aiv/saruchinesu) (2012)
This is an odd one. I'm a fan.

<br>

---

## [SHINE POST](https://anidb.net/anime/16937) (2022)
The animation is unexpectedly high quality. The 2D dance scenes are a feast for the eyes. Highly recommend.

## [Cybernetics Guardian](https://anidb.net/anime/1615) (2019)
Atrocious.

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden - A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights](https://anidb.net/anime/1310) (1998)

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden - Spiral Labrynth](https://anidb.net/anime/1310) (1998)
Watched concurrently with A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights. A beautiful addition to the series.

<br>

## [Star☆Twinkle Precure](https://anidb.net/anime/14459) (2019)
Although this took me four years to watch, I truly did enjoy it. Cute & sweet. I absolutely adore our alien girls' character designs.

<br>

## [Noroi no One Piece](https://anidb.net/anime/15407) (1992)
Short little horror episodes about a dress. Not particularly scary.

<br>

<!--more-->
CHISATO!!! (❤ω❤)

<br>

## [A Perfect Getaway](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0971209/) (2009)
This movie is not good. Extremely predictable.

<br>

## [Jojo Rabbit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2584384/) (2019)
Not that funny.

<br>

---

## [Fight Club](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) (1999)
It's decent I guess. Can't say I understand the mass appeal.

# October 22

## [Ginga Senpuu Braiger](https://anidb.net/anime/3117) (1981)
<!--more-->
Have you ever heard of J9? People say they used to run amok through the Solar System long ago. And this world we're in has gone to ruin. If you're careless you'll get whacked from behind. Bad then and it's bad now! Same as it ever was!
Very poor pacing, but I still enjoyed it.
[Lovely music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F90CGsxgZ3g)

## [Urusei Yatsura: Only You](https://anidb.net/anime/378) (1983)
A visually brilliant triple length episode.

<br>

---

## [14-sai no Koi](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/3un55ce/14-sai-no-koi) (2010)
I find it amusing how Japan does the female-teacher-predator-pedophile-but-she's-actually-just-a-maiden-so-there's-nothing-wrong trope.

<br>

---

## [Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/ie24f2g/kaguya-sama-wa-kokurasetai-tensai-tachi-no-renai-zunousen) (2015)
Enjoyable for the whole run just so cute.

<br>

---

## [The Cage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884831/) (1964)
Neat little short. I like the colors.
<br>

---

## [Falling Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884831/) (1993)
My favorite type of movie. Love watching unhinged men (optional) go on a rampage. Absolutely hilarious!
