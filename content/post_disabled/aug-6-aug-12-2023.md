## [Katanagatari](https://anidb.net/anime/6613) (2010)

Watch #2. Failed to live  up to the extremely high standard it holds in my memory. Still a great anime, especially the second half. Nanami, I love you.

## [Lupin III: Return of Pycal](https://anidb.net/anime/803) (2002)

This one was great. Pycal is such a fun character, wish he returned more. The CGI actually helped this feel quite surreal.

## [Tenamonya Voyagers](https://anidb.net/anime/476) (2021)

Fairly fun. Too bad it will never be finished.

## [New Story of Aura Battler Dunbine](https://anidb.net/anime/2468) (1988)

Overall, not too good. However, I'm in awe at how beautiful the world looks. Signifigant improvement to the world of OG Dunbine. Could have been something special if it were fleshed out more.

## [Okaeri Alice](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/jah5fda/okaeri-alice) (2020)

Another superb Shuzo Oshimi manga.

Watch #2. Thoughtful piece of art.
