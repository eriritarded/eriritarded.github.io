## [Attack! No.1](https://anidb.net/anime/757) (1969)
Finally, Ayuara's suffering has ended. She has become Attack No.1! Loved the first half of the series, but it started to fall off after a certain event that occured at the midpooint. Luckily, it picked up steam again in the last quarter. What makes this anime so difficult to binge watch, is how the episode recaps are done. While not every episode ahs a recap, many do, especially towards the middle of the series. The first 5-10 minutes of an episode would splice in scenes from the second half of the previous episode. The recaps alone would be bad enough, but they aren't normal recaps. The spliced scenes are sometimes arranged in different orders, and have completely new scenes in between. This makes the recaps unskippable, as you will miss key plot points for the episode.

Not quite Asobi Asobase, but still a tasty treat.

## [The Saint`s Magic Power Is Omnipotent Season 2](https://anidb.net/anime/17246) (2023)

Finally, a shoujo isekai that doesn't faceplant immediately after the first arc or two. This was fun and Sei is so cute.
