## [Yamako and Wolf](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/hvhbrhi/yamako-and-wolf) (2018)

Read #4. Absolutely lovely. Simple & adorable, filled with heart. Gorgeous art. I shall always adore this work. Please create more wonderful art Yamakita-sensei.

## [Teasing Master Takagi-san](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/3kqrqxe/karakai-jouzu-no-takagi-san) (2012)

One of the cutest reads, finally over. Sad to see. Souichirou Yamamoto never misses. Between this, Tsubaki, and Ayumu ending, I'm feeling an extreme lack of his beautiful works in my life. Please create more wonderful art Yamamoto-sensei.
