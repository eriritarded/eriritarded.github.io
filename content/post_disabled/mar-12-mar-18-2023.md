## [Isekai Ojisan](https://anidb.net/anime/16389) (2022)

What an absolute treat. I figured there was no chance for the manga's art style to be adapted properly, but it managed to do that and more. A superb adaptation, even better than the manga. Hope for a season 2 but it seems unlikely considering the production troubles of this season.

## [The Idolmaster Movie: Kagayaki no Mukougawa e!](https://anidb.net/anime/9701) (2014)

The 45 minute drama arc seriously dragged this movie down. Lovely otherwise. There was this one rotoscoped scene that was so tasty to see. I found the casual clothes to be color coordinated extremely well.

## [Wizardy](https://anidb.net/anime/3133) (1991)

A few visually interesting shots, but overall quite forgettable.

## [Tatakae!! Iczer 1](https://anidb.net/anime/436) (1985)

Watch #2. So much fun and oh-so-pretty!

## [Silent Beach](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/qq5snuj/silent-beach) (1979)

The inspiration for [Glassy Ocean](https://anidb.net/anime/1229), the author's beautiful short film.

## [Crusher Joe](https://anidb.net/anime/2058) (1983)

Fun, pretty, and exhilarating! They don't make this stuff anymore!

## [Mayonaka Sanpo](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/sx8sf6y/mayonaka-sanpo) (2018)

A little unsettling.

## [Yumekuri](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/etf0doy/yumekuri) (2012)

Hiro's art is so good it's criminal. Sweet & adorable.

## [Jigoku Metamoru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3KQ7VYVEyw) (2017)

What a crazy little animation.

## [Yumekuri](https://anidb.net/anime/9392) (2012)

Doesn't quite get Hiro's wonderful art style correct, but it's still great to see these girls animated.

Cute!

## [Shikabane to Hanayome ](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/scmhv91/shikabane-to-hanayome) (2021)

Never thought I'd enjoy yaoi.

## [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anidb.net/anime/2357) (1982)

I really enjoyed this one. I'd put it somewhere in the middle as far as Tomino shows go. I particularly liked the comedy & mechanical designs. In some ways Xabungle feels like a proto L-Gaim, as many elements seem to be reused.
