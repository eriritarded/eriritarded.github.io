## [Ginga Reppuu Baxingar](https://anidb.net/anime/3116) (1982)
<!--more-->
Part 2 of the J9 trilogy. Comes with even better music. The opening is /unbelievably/ hype. Awful in just about every other aspect. 
At least it tries, and it tries hard. It really is a shame that Baxingar is just not that good of a show. There is so much gold but the execution was poor. 
Every death is telegraphed as soon as the character is introduced. There is no sense of time. I couldn't tell you if this anime took place over the course of 2 weeks or 2 years. 
I get that this is an old foreign cartoon with space motorcycles that grow enormous and then transform into a magical space robot. 
But I think it should still make sense within the world of Baxingar. All that said, I would be lying if I said I disliked this show.

This is an odd one. I'm a fan.

The animation is unexpectedly high quality. The 2D dance scenes are a feast for the eyes. Highly recommend.
