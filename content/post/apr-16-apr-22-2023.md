Absolutely adorable & heartfelt manga. Every chapter thawed my frigid heart. It evokes a sense of love for the world and other living creatures that is difficult to find in myself or others. It makes me feel some form of nostalgia towards a type of unconditional, almost weightless love & acceptance for all. A far more hopeful outlook towards the world and others than I am capable of.

## [Chihayafuru](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/7tr007e/chihayafuru) (2007)

Reread the first 210 or so chapters and then finally finished it. Still amazing, but not quite the masterpiece I remembered. I just don't connect with romance stories anymore. I never got that anxious feeling when reading something impactful like I did the first time around.
