Yummy yummy junk food! Maybe Mitsuha has fetal alcohol syndrome?

Tenchi Muyou! is just a very odd franchise. Not that I dislike it.

## [Didn`t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!](https://anidb.net/anime/13844) (2019)

As someone who's been a fan of the light novels since they first got licensed, everything I had seen had told me that this would be a terrible adaptation. How could I have been so wrong? This was an amazing adaptation! Less focus on pointless storylines, with more focuse on these funny. cute, comfy girls. I love it!
