## [Logan's Run](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/) (1976)

Not sure how I feel about the ending, but overall I enjoyed this one. Very pretty movie. The analogue effects do a lot for me, and I like the sci-fi set.

## [Ichigeki](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/9hp32t3/ichigeki-matsumoto-jiro) (2016)

Not bad, but it lacks the appeal of his other works.

## [Vampire Hunter D](https://anidb.net/anime/204) (1985)
This one kind of sucks. The whips are cool weapons.

## [Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust](https://anidb.net/anime/66) (2001)

Much better than the original. I enjoy the violence.
