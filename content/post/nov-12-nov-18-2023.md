## [Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/rkpkgoq/soredemo-ayumu-wa-yosetekuru) (2019)

Why must you keep ending your series? Yet another beautiful Soichiro Yamamoto manga that hasended this year. What a treat it was to read. The main romance was of course adorable, but the other romances were cute too. Not to mention my gorgeous, beautiful, perfect, lovely wife Maki.

Amusing.

## [The Ichinose Family's Deadly Sins](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/74m1ruk/ichinose-ke-no-taizai) (2022)

Beautiful art. Really neat premise. Execution falls flat. Chapter to chapter very little is static, and it makes it difficult to care. That being said I would sell my soul for young Shiori.

## [Akuma-kun](https://anidb.net/anime/2050) (1989)

Gorgeous art.

Watch #2. I just adore these little idiots. Wasn't dying laughing this time around, but still very funny.
