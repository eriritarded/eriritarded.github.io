## [Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/rkpkgoq/soredemo-ayumu-wa-yosetekuru) (2019)

Why must you keep ending your series? Yet another beautiful Soichiro Yamamoto manga that hasended this year. What a treat it was to read. The main romance was of course adorable, but the other romances were cute too. Not to mention my gorgeous, beautiful, perfect, lovely wife Maki.
