## [The Weathering Continent](https://anidb.net/anime/1234) (1992)

Pretty & sad.

## [Lupin III Pilot Film](https://anidb.net/anime/3181) (1969)

Pure beauty.

## [Lupin III](https://anidb.net/anime/421) (1972)

The first half of Lupin III is some of the best television I have ever seen. The second half of the series seems to lean more towards the modern, goofy Lupin. Fun Lupin will never be as good as early Luin for me, but bob-haired Fujiko makes me want to commit war crimes for her.

## [Antiporno](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5973032/) (2016)

Watch #3. Brilliant film.

<br>

## [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anidb.net/anime/320) (1979)

This version of Lupin is not my favorite take on the character. But that's made up for in how stunningly attractive this film is.
