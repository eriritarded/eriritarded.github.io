Gorgeous short. Tryptamine flashbacks.

## [Uchuu Majin Daikengo](https://anidb.net/anime/3151) (1978)
Once again surprised by how much I enjoy these old, forgotten robot shows. The story is fairly mediocre, however there are quite a few great episodes. The final act was awesome. Now for complaints. The show looks ugly as hell. There is no blood shown yet there is still death, which I find odd. The main girl has an extremely sexualized design, complete with a random wardrobe malfunction. So why no blood? Very odd. The mechanical designs didn't do much for me. Ryger's design rocked. Roboleon and Baracross had a hilarious relationship, probably my favorite aspect of Daikengo.

## [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/) (2022)
The movie is fine but I do not understand the extreme popularity. It was /fine/. I just don't care.

Better than most isekai and most gacha game adaptations. Nice animation. Starts out average but picks up towards the end.

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2](https://anidb.net/anime/15690) (2022)
Considering the first season started out as a shitty KonoSuba I am incredibly impressed with where it ended. The story is getting interesting. The animation is top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and hope for more seasons.

## [Isekai Quartet: Another World](https://anidb.net/anime/15481) (2022)
Not a fan. Huge step down from the series in humor. The story was boring. Why did Vera need to be from Tanya's world? I was very bothered by the presentation of Tanya. As a huge fan of the novels, this Tanya is simply a different character.

Excellent art, however I didn't really get it. Something about the red string of fate I guess.
