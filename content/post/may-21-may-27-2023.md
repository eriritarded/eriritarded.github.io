## [Kanajo mo Kanajo](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/qioi2o1/kanojo-mo-kanojo) (2020)

I honestly enjoyed this manga for must of the run. It's cute and funny, with good art, but the rushed ending felt a little flat. Hope to see Hiroyuki go back to something that leans into comedy more. Shino & Saki <3.

## [Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi] (2018)

Been reading since the start. Sad to see it end. Was always a cute little treat each month. There can never enough Yamamoto-sensei! Absolutely adorable!
