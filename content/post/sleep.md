I would like to sleep soon. This is not a cry for help, nor a call for attention, as much as I might desire both. This is simply putting my thoughts and wishes to words. I wish to sleep. I wish to sleep. I wish to sleep. I want to sink into the warm, soft comfort of my bed. I wish to sleep. I wish to sleep. I wish to sleep. Why was I awoken? I wanted to sleep. I still want to sleep. Please let me sleep. There is peace in sleep. I wish to sleep. Please allow me to sleep. A calm. peaceful sleep. My wish will be granted soon, this I can still hope.
