## [Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead](https://anidb.net/anime/17806) (2023)
Did I watch this solely because of Shizuka's incredibly sexy character design? Yes. Aside from that, the first half of this show was quite good. Unfortunately, it got worse towards the end, and that final act was not enjoyable. However, it was still a positive experience overall. A small aspect I found cute is the rainbow blood splatters.

## [I'm in Love with the Villainess](https://anidb.net/anime/17766) (2023)
I was acquainted with this guy online who was obsessed with the web novel. Sorry buddy, but it was not that amazing. Not bad at all, but loses a lot of the fun in the last 1/3 of the show. I love Claire-sama!
