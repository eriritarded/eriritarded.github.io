Oppressive atmosphere. Wonderfully executed.

## [What Happens Inside the Dungeon](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/ugwe6g1/what-happens-inside-the-dungeon) (2019)
Usually K-Porn manga sucks. This one was real fun.

## [Venus Senki](https://anidb.net/anime/620) (1989)
The plot is nothing special. But that's not why one watches this movie. One watches it because it's gorgeous. I adore the wonderfully animated mechanical gore.

## [Pokemon: Twilight Wings](https://anidb.net/anime/15309) (2020)
I played maybe 45 minutes of Pokemon in my life and I've watched no more than 5 episodes as a kid. But I had to watch this one because Nessa is just that cute. Giving me jungle fever. Fun, sweet, self contained-stories. Enjoyable & heartwarming.
