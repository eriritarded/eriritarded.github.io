## [Shinmai Renkinjutsushi no Tenpo Keiei](https://anidb.net/anime/16732) (2022)

Atelier Ryza anime before Atelier Ryza anime. One of those cute girls doing jack shit in a fantasy world series that I just adore.

## [Greed](https://anidb.net/anime/2493) (1985)
A very early OVA. All style no substance. Reminds me a lot of [Birth](https://anidb.net/anime/2640) (albeit not as cool) - the story is just a device to show some pretty visuals, a ton of chase scenes, and all the weird moving camera angles. I enjoyed it enough for what it was.

 Surprisingly good for an anime about ganbanger maids.

## [Elf Princess Rane](https://anidb.net/anime/151) (1995)
Just plain awful. Utter dogshit. I assume this is a parody, because it is mind-numbingly stupid. In a very bad way. Not engaging in the slightest. The plot makes so little sense that I can't tell you anything that happened the whole hour. 
There's a character that says words backwards, and multiple occurrences of multiple characters talking over each other at a fast pace. 
There's good slapstick and there's bad slapstick. This is unequivocally the latter. I didn't even grin once. Worthless. I don't understand who the intended audience would have been.

## [Bocchi the Rock!](https://anidb.net/anime/16063) (2022)
Near perfect. Almost feels like a golden era Doga Kobo show. Easily up there with the best CGDCT. Sequal when?

## [Spy x Family Part 2](https://anidb.net/anime/17061) (2022)
Decent show. But why did they start naming anime like this? Please die.
