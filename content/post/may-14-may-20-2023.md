## [Aura Battler Dunbine](https://anidb.net/anime/899) (1983)

Pretty interesting world with very boring characters. Actually scratch that I love CIELA LAPANA I love ELMELIE LUFT I love ELLE HUNM they are absolute royalty and I shall serve them. Bern Bunnings seems to be one of the more competent Tomino-blue-haired-antagonist characters. As far as Tomino shows go I thought this was definitely towards the lower half. The entire cast of the Zelana was bland as hell (sans Cham). However, as far as Tomino "final stretches" go this was one of the better ones.

<br>

While this is probably an inaccurate way of thinking, I see dunbine, L-Gaim, and Xabungle as a trilogy of sorts focusing on similar concepts and elements.
