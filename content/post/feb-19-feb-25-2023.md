Gorgeous film.

## [Project A-Ko: Final](https://anidb.net/anime/7686) (1989)

Worst of the four. Disappointing end to the series.

## [Aoi Umi no Tristia](https://anidb.net/anime/1664) (2004)

Nothing more than an advertisement for the visual novel.

Watch #2. Six years since the last time. Amazing show! Love these girls they are just so perfect and cute.

## [THE IDOLM@STER: Shiny Festa](https://anidb.net/anime/9283) (2012)
Considering how good the series was, this was surprisingly awful. I was bored to death. How did this happen to my idols?
