## [Sukeban Deka](https://anidb.net/anime/2333) (1991)

Awful. Nothing positive of note.

## [Ayakashi Triangle](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/gbnfccj/ayakashi-triangle) (2020)

Nothing special, nothing interesting. The art is good, as expected. The only bit that stands out is Suzu's absurd level of hotness, but even that is not enough to make this a worthwhile read.
