Not many of these work were especially special in any way. The goal was to write any particularly strong feelings or thoughts I had. Odd things, things I liked, things I disliked, and whatever else. The months are in reverse order, with the entries in each month being in order from top to bottom. The order is messed up because I didn't want to do that much cutting and pasting. Oh well."

## [SPY×FAMILY Season 2](https://anidb.net/anime/17784) (2023)
A little worse than the first season. Still just fine. I really don't enjoy this series outside of the school stuff. Likely won't continue watching next season, we will see.

## [Sewing Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZZbYeMn-ao&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fanilist.co%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo) (2023)
Xu Yuan. Amazing. Gorgeous. Beautiful. Stunning. A visual masterpiece. Reminiscent of [1001 Nights](https://anidb.net/anime/5499). Highly recommended. Shamefully, I think I relate to this one deeply. Well, it is what it is.

## [In full bloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJa9Ujfa9Vg) (2021)
Takahashi Miho. Pretty artwork. A treat for the eyes.

## [Bavel's Book](https://anidb.net/anime/5150) (1996)
Yamamura Kouji. Not his best, but still quite enjoyable.

## [Docchi ni Suru? ](https://anidb.net/anime/5155) (1999)
Yamamura Kouji. Fine for what it is.

## [Hikikomari Kyuuketsuki no Monmon](https://anidb.net/anime/17805) (2023)
Amazing character designs, Millicent Blueknight... Please... Wonderful names too... While the last arc wasn't too great, I really enjoyed it up until there. Just another light novel advertisement, I guess.

# December 23

## [Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead](https://anidb.net/anime/17806) (2023)
Did I watch this solely because of Shizuka's incredibly sexy character design? Yes. Aside from that, the first half of this show was quite good. Unfortunately, it got worse towards the end, and that final act was not an enjoyable experience. With that said, I'm still glad I watched it. A small aspect I found quite cute are all the rainbow blood splatters.

<br>

---

## [I'm in Love with the Villainess](https://anidb.net/anime/17766) (2023)
I was acquainted with this guy online who was obsessed with the web novel a few years ago. Sorry buddy, but it was not that amazing. Not bad at all, but loses a lot of the fun in the last 1/3 of the show. I do however love Claire-sama!

## [Bang Dream! It`s MyGo!!!!!](https://anidb.net/anime/17981) (2023)

Watched this solely because of the funny name. Quite ejoyable. Amusing having the main girl named Anon. It's..... MYGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pretty visuals. Not much else to say.

## [Shimeji Simulation](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/5o1bjrn/shimeji-simulation) (2019)

A wonderful experience. Visually brilliant. Some of the best panelling I have ever seen in manga. There's this page, from one of the earlier chapters, where the roots and branches of a tree form the panels of the page. It's been years and that page still lives in my head. Just astounding. Nobody does it like this.

---
<br>

## [Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/rkpkgoq/soredemo-ayumu-wa-yosetekuru) (2019)

Why must you keep ending your series? Yet another beautiful Soichiro Yamamoto manga that has ended this year. What a treat it was to read. The main romance was of course adorable, but the other romances were cute too. Not to mention my gorgeous, beautiful, perfect, lovely wife Maki.

<br>

## [Fireball Humorous](https://anidb.net/anime/13398) (2017)

I think I have a crush on a robot...

---

## [The Ichinose Family's Deadly Sins](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/74m1ruk/ichinose-ke-no-taizai) (2022)

Beautiful art. Really neat premise. Execution falls flat. Chapter to chapter very little is static, and it makes it difficult to care.

<br>

---

## [Akuma-kun](https://anidb.net/anime/2050) (1989)

Gorgeous art.

<br>

---

## [Tantei Opera Milky Holmes](https://anidb.net/anime/7627) (2010)

Watch #2. I just adore these little idiots. Wasn't dying laughing this time around, but still very funny.

---
<br>

## [Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken: Coleus no Yume](https://anidb.net/anime/17873) (2023)

Not an enjoyable watch by any measure. However, Luminous is mind-numbingly hot.

<br>

# October 23

## [Yamako and Wolf](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/hvhbrhi/yamako-and-wolf) (2018)

Read #4. Absolutely lovely. Simple & adorable, filled with so much heart. Gorgeous art. I shall always adore this work. Please create more wonderful art Yamakita-sensei.

<br>

---

## [Teasing Master Takagi-san](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/3kqrqxe/karakai-jouzu-no-takagi-san) (2012)

One of the cutest reads, finally over. Sad to see. Souichirou Yamamoto never misses. Between this, Tsubaki, and Ayumu ending, I'm feeling an extreme lack of his beautiful touch in my life. Please create more wonderful art Yamamoto-sensei.

---
<br>

## [Logan's Run](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/) (1976)

Not sure how I feel about the ending, but overall I enjoyed this one. Very pretty movie. The analogue special effects do a lot for me, and I like the set a lot.

<br>

---

## [Lupin III: Lupin Ansatsu Shirei](https://anidb.net/anime/986) (1993)

<br>

---

## [Ichigeki](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/9hp32t3/ichigeki-matsumoto-jiro) (2016)

Not bad, quite good actually, but it lacks the appeal that I find in his other works.

<br>

---

## [Vampire Hunter D](https://anidb.net/anime/204) (1985)
This one kind of seriously sucks. I guess the whips are cool weapons.

---
<br>
---

## [Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust](https://anidb.net/anime/66) (2001)

Much better than the original. I enjoy the violence.

---
<br>

## [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anidb.net/anime/43) (2000)

Beautiful. Gorgeous. Amazing.

---
<br>

# September 23

## [Sukeban Deka](https://anidb.net/anime/2333) (1991)

Awful. Nothing positive of note.

<br>

---

## [Ayakashi Triangle](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/gbnfccj/ayakashi-triangle) (2020)

Nothing special, nothing interesting. The art is good, as expected. The only bit that stands out is Suzu's absurd level of cuteness, but even that is not enough to make this a worthwhile read.

---
<br>

## [Inside Mari](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/pwf9i37/boku-wa-mari-no-naka) (2012)

Read #2. It's been 7 years since the last time I read this, while it was still releasing. This is a manga I remember quite well. The knowledge of what's coming does not detract from the story, but certainly makes for a different read. Astonishingly pretty, and one of Oshimi's best.

---
<br>

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://anidb.net/anime/584) (1988)

Watch #2. What can I say? LOGH is perfection. I adore these characters.

---
<br>


## [Blood on the Tracks](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/1l6iro1/chi-no-wadachi) (2017)

Wow. I don't know what to say. This is Oshimi at his very best. An absolute gut-wrenching read. Masterpiece. Maybe I just relate to it too much. Hard to say.

# August 23

## [I Want To Be Killed by a Highschool Girl](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/d57c66o/joshikousei-ni-korosaretai) (2013)

Me too buddy, me too. Not a fan of the ending, but still quite interesting & enjoyable.

<br>

---

## [Choushoujo UFO](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/014v10x/choushoujo-ufo) (1983)

Did not like this one bit.

<br>

---

## [What Do You Call This Trash](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/qurvv3g/kono-gomi-o-nanto-yobu) (2022)

Insanely cute girl. I guess the manga is ok too.

<br>

---

## [Catastrophe of the Neighboring Town](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/ndzis97/tonarimachi-no-catastrophe) (2016)

Is horror just an awful genre?

<br>

---

## [Heroine wa Zetsubou shimashita.](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/htttarz/heroine-wa-zetsu) (2019)

Started out as another one of those dogshit edgefests,  but I started enjoying it halfway through. Unfortunately *ourgirl* had her revenge cut short. Gave me a little bit of catharsis when another character took the evil cunt out.

<br>

---

## [Sensei wa Koi wo Oshierarenai](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/ijq5396/sensei-wa-koi-wo-oshierarenai) (2018)

Thought this one was cute back when it was actually getting frequent scanlations 5 or so years ago. Unfortunately my tastes have drifted since then.

---
<br>


## [RideBack](https://anidb.net/anime/6235) (2009)

Astounding first episode, jumps off a steep cliff into a sea of mediocrity after. Nothing truly positive to say about this show outside of the premise and the first episode. Just went in a very poor direction. I could see this being good with twice the length and some competent writers, but even then it won't be good. Nothing particularly awful, but nothing too unique. No need for anyone to watch.

<br>

---

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars](https://anidb.net/anime/1307) (1988)

Watch #3. An astounding beginning to a marvelous series.

<br>

---

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Overture to a New War](https://anidb.net/anime/1308) (1993)

Somehow missed this one on my first watch of the series. To nobody's surprise, this is amazing.

---
<br>


## [Katanagatari](https://anidb.net/anime/6613) (2010)

Watch #2. Failed to live up to the extremely high standard it holds in my memory. Still a great anime, especially the second half. Nanami, I love you dearly.

<br>

---

## [Lupin III: Return of Pycal](https://anidb.net/anime/803) (2002)

This one was great. Pycal is such a fun character, wish he returned more. The CGI actually helped this feel quite surreal.

<br>

---

## [Tenamonya Voyagers](https://anidb.net/anime/476) (2021)

Fairly fun. Too bad it will never be finished.

<br>

---

## [New Story of Aura Battler Dunbine](https://anidb.net/anime/2468) (1988)

Overall, not too good, especially. However, I'm in awe at how beautiful the world looks. Signifigant improvement to the world of OG Dunbine. Could have been something special if it were fleshed out more.

<br>

---

## [Okaeri Alice](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/jah5fda/okaeri-alice) (2020)

Another superb Shuzo Oshimi manga. What can I say? He doesn't know how to miss.

<br>

---

## [Sensou no Tsukurikata](https://anidb.net/anime/11936) (2015)

Watch #2. Thoughtful piece of art.

<br>

---

## [Airy Me](https://anidb.net/anime/10141) (2013)

By Imazu Yoshiki.

---

## [Super Milk-chan](https://anidb.net/anime/543) (1998)

Odd & unsettling. Not quite funny. Definitely makes sense that it was on Adult Swim. Not good,  yet not awful enough to earn a big angry red face. A fascinating little curio.

<br>

---

## [ATOMIC WORLD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuB-WJr5Ok) (2007)

Yoshiki Imazu. Gorgeous.

<br>

## [RINGING CITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX952DiItp4) (2017)

Yoshiki Imazu. Gorgeous.

# July 23

## [Barry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5348176/) (2018)

Horribly depressing. Makes me feel awful. Had no expectations a couple episodes into the second season, was about to drop it, was cringing too much. Little did I know that was all a ploy to make me lower my guard.

<br>

---

## [Lupin III: Napoleon`s Dictionary](https://anidb.net/anime/2137) (1991)


<br>

---

## [Lupin III: The Hemingway Papers](https://anidb.net/anime/2014) (1990)

I really enjoyed getting to see Lupin's gang go against each other again for a little bit.


<br>

---

## [Lupin III: DEAD OR ALIVE](https://anidb.net/anime/703) (1996)

This one is particularly fun.

---

<br>

## [Lupin III: Prison of the Past](https://anidb.net/anime/15198) (2017)

Not a fan.

<br>

## [Lupin III: The Mystery of Mamo](https://anidb.net/anime/823) (1978)

The supernatural stuff in Lupin is never my favorite, but this one was great.

<br>

---

## [Lupin III: Bye Bye, Lady Liberty](https://anidb.net/anime/1024) (1989)

Fun!

<br>

## [Zansatsu! Ponytail](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=136981) (2016)

Cute & fun little horror manga.

---
<br>

## [The Weathering Continent](https://anidb.net/anime/1234) (1992)

Pretty & sad.

<br>

---

## [Lupin III Pilot Film](https://anidb.net/anime/3181) (1969)

Pure beauty.

<br>

---

## [Lupin III](https://anidb.net/anime/421) (1972)

The first half of Lupin III is some of the best cartoons I have ever seen. The second half of the series seems to lean more towards the modern, goofy Lupin. Fun Lupin will never be as good as early Lupin for me, but bob-haired Fujiko makes me want to commit war crimes, if only she'd ask.

---
<br>

## [Antiporno](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5973032/) (2016)

Watch #3. Brilliant, beautiful film.

---
<br>

## [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anidb.net/anime/320) (1979)

This version of Lupin is not my favorite take on the character. But that's made up for in how stunningly attractive this film is.

---

## [√964 Pinocchio](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0225009/) (1991)

Grotesque & unsettling. It is unlikely that I will ever forgot this experience.

<br>

---

## [Megazone 23](https://anidb.net/anime/1729) (1985)

So many lovely cuties.

## [Techno Police 21C](https://anidb.net/anime/1862) (1982)

Most people seem to dislike this one but I enjoyed it for what it was. How could I ever complain about a high-quality remaster like this? It's pretty.

<br>

---

## [Crusher Joe OVA](https://anidb.net/anime/2057) (1988)

Just as fun and exciting as the movie. Please give us more Crusher Joe!

<br>

## [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Bakuen wo!](https://anidb.net/anime/16446) (2023)

This is no KonoSuba but it has some good moments.

---

## [Opapagoto](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/y4ghi5x/opapagoto) (2013)

I honestly enjoyed this manga for most of the run. It's cute and funny, with good art, but the rushed ending felt a little flat. Hope to see Hiroyuki go back to something that leans into comedy more.

<br>

---

## [Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/98hvfcv/kunoichi-tsubaki-no-mune-no-uchi) (2018)

Been reading since the start. Sad to see it end. Was always a cute little treat each month. There can never enough Yamamoto-sensei! Absolutely adorable!

<br>

---

## [Aura Battler Dunbine](https://anidb.net/anime/899) (1983)

Pretty interesting world with very boring characters. Actually scratch that I love CIELA LAPANA I love ELMELIE LUFT I love ELLE HUNM they are absolute royalty and I shall serve them. Bern Bunnings seems to be one of the more competent Tomino-blue-haired-antagonist characters. As far as Tomino shows go I thought this was definitely towards the lower half. The entire cast of the Zelana was bland as hell (sans Cham). However, as far as Tomino "final stretches" go this was one of the better ones.

<br>

While this is probably an inaccurate way of thinking, I see Dunbine, L-Gaim, and Xabungle as a trilogy of sorts with similar concepts and elements.

##  [Ponkotsu Ponko](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/cjr8xt7/useless-ponko) (2019)

Absolutely adorable & heartfelt manga. Every chapter thawed my frigid heart. It evokes a sense of love for the world and other living creatures that is difficult to find in myself or others. It makes me feel some form of nostalgia towards a type of unconditional, almost weightless love & acceptance for all. A far more hopeful outlook towards the world and others than I am capable of.

<br>

---

## [Chihayafuru](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/7tr007e/chihayafuru) (2007)

Reread the first 210 or so chapters and then finally finished it. Still amazing, but not quite the masterpiece I remembered. I just don't connect much with stories like this anymore. I never got that anxious feeling I get when reading something impactful, like I did the first time around.

As someone who's been a fan of the light novels since they first got licensed, everything I had seen had told me that this would be a terrible adaptation. How could I have been so wrong? This was an amazing adaptation! Less focus on pointless storylines, with more focus on these funny, cute, comfy girls? I love it!

## [Super Dimension Century Orguss](https://anidb.net/anime/1039) (1983)

Honestly, I think I might like this one a bit more than Macross. I found the drama & romance to be significantly worse (what do you expect without Misa?), but overall I enjyed it. The sassy robots are hilarious. Gorgeous aerial fights. An extremely unique concept for a world, one I would have liked to explore much more. One of my favorite sci-fi aesthetics. the Groma/Gloma in particular is possibly my favorite "home base ship" that you see in sci-fi series. The ending scene will never leave my mind.

## [Isekai Ojisan](https://anidb.net/anime/16389) (2022)

What an absolute treat. I figured there was no chance for the manga's art style to be adapted properly, but it managed to do that and more. A superb adaptation, even better than the manga. Hope for a season 2, but it seems unlikely considering the production troubles.

## [The Idolmaster Movie: Kagayaki no Mukougawa e!](https://anidb.net/anime/9701) (2014)

The 45 minute drama arc seriously dragged this movie down. Lovely otherwise. There was this one rotoscoped scene that was an absolute feast for the eyes. I found the casual clothes to be color coordinated extremely well.

## [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anidb.net/anime/2357) (1982)

I really enjoyed this one. I'd put it somewhere in the upper-middle as far as Tomino shows go. I particularly liked the comedy & mechanical designs. In some ways Xabungle feels like a proto L-Gaim, as many elements seem to be reused.

## [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) (1980)

Watch #2. Ideon is even better the second time around. Absolutely stellar. The opening song gives me such a high, but by the final episode I was in a bottomless pit of dread. My favorite robot anime. Beautiful work of art.

## [Space Runaway Ideon: Be Invoked](https://anidb.net/anime/1809) (1982)

## [Futagotachi no Sho Jijou](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/h6menb0/futago-tachi-no-shojijou) (2020)

## [Back to the Kassan](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/4a8zcg1/back-to-the-kaasan) (2017)

Read #2. It's been about four years since I first read this and it is still one of the strangest pieces of art I have ever experienced. Not a week has gone by without me thinking about it. Interesting note, turns out the mangaka is also the guy who makes the exhibitionist armpit fetish manga.

<br>

## [Fashion](https://anidb.net/anime/9009) (1960)

## [The Saga of Tanya the Evil - Vol. 11](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/youjo-senki/) (2019)

## [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anidb.net/anime/648) (1974)

Wow. Just wow. An absolute masterpiece. The most gorgeous looking TV anime I've ever seen, and possibly ever will. Sat there for five episodes straight staring with my mouth agape. Between the flawless animation and the modern remaster this looks perfect. Honestly I'm not even sure what words I could possibly use to do this justice. I am in awe. As these experiences with art get rarer and rarer. I savor their flavor with an even greater intensity.

## [Uchuu Majin Daikengo](https://anidb.net/anime/3151) (1978)
Once again surprised by how much I enjoy these old, forgotten robot shows. The story is fairly mediocre, however there are quite a few great episodes. The final act was awesome. Now for complaints. The show looks ugly as hell. There is no blood shown yet there is still death, which I find odd. The main girl has an extremely sexualized design, complete with a random wardrobe malfunction. So why no blood? Very odd. The mechanical designs didn't do much for me. Ryger's design rocked. Roboleon and Baracross had a hilarious relationship, probably my favorite aspect of Daikengo. Can't forget the [opening song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L80qGAVEOTQ), now one of my all time favorites. All in all, I enjoyed this more than I really should have. Just an interesting anime.

## [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/) (2022)

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive](https://anidb.net/anime/14690) (2020)

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2](https://anidb.net/anime/15690) (2022)
Considering the first season started out as a shitty KonoSuba I am incredibly impressed with where it ended. The story is getting interesting. The animation is top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and hope for more seasons.

## [Isekai Quartet: Another World](https://anidb.net/anime/15481) (2022)
Not a fan. I expect the story to suck. I expect that with a crossover between a shitty isekai, a mediocre isekai, a parody, and an alternate history world war one with magic. But unlike the series, this wasn't remotely funny, which makes you ask the question, why am I watching this pile of garbage? Is there a reason I spent almost 2 hours of my life watching this? But sure, A bad anime movie is fine. There are a lot of bad anime movies. But what really annoys me, what makes me hate this movie so much, is the bastardization of Tanya Degurrechaff. This is literally **Evil**. How could you do this? Why did you make her like *that*.
 I don't understand. That's not her. That is a skinwalker. Tanya Degurrechaff would never behave in such a way.

## [Pokemon: Twilight Wings](https://anidb.net/anime/15309) (2020)
I played maybe 45 minutes of Pokemon in my life and I've watched no more than 5 episodes as a kid. But I had to watch this one because Nessa is just that cute. Giving me jungle fever. Fun, sweet, self contained-stories. Enjoyable & heartwarming.

A very early OVA. All style no substance. Reminds me a lot of [Birth](https://anidb.net/anime/2640) (albeit not as cool) - the story is just a device to show some pretty visuals, a ton of chase scenes, and all the weird moving camera angles. I enjoyed it enough for what it was.

## [Elf Princess Rane](https://anidb.net/anime/151) (1995)
Just plain awful. Utter dogshit. I assume this is a parody, because it is mind-numbingly stupid. In a very bad way. Not engaging in the slightest. The plot makes so little sense that I can't tell you anything that happened the whole hour. 
There's a character that says words backwards, and multiple occurrences of multiple characters talking over each other at a fast pace. 
There's good slapstick and there's bad slapstick. This is unequivocally the latter. I didn't even grin once. Worthless. I don't understand who the intended audience would have been.

## [Super Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross](https://anidb.net/anime/1177) (1984)
Lana. Lana Lana Lana Lana Lana. Lanaaaaaaaaaaa. I love Lana. Lana Lana Lana. Lana so cute. Lana is such a pretty name. Lana is so perfect. Lana. ARA ARA LANA. Lana are you looking to get married? Oh Lana, oh Lana. I have GOTTA get arrested by the military police. Please. Help me commit war crimes. Thanks.
Anyways. This anime seemed quite derivative. Seen most of the ideas in older mecha anime. Draws some from its older Super Dimensional Sister, Macross. Similar to [Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) in MANY ways, so much so that I'm convinced it's where the ideas came from. 
I had a lot to say while watching it. Now? Not much, just dissatisfaction. I did not get much out of this one. Started out good & the funny Squad 15 hijinks were good, but then a certain character was introduced. 
That guy sucks! MC-chan was pretty great, most of the other characters were shallow (including my dear Lana). The plot? Just watch ideon. Or don't. 
It's not like they're the same exact shows, they really aren't, not at all, not even close. **But...** But... But... Ideon did what I think Southern Cross tried to do so much better. Not to mention that Ideon was 2 years earlier. Funny how both MCs have afros!

## [Ginga Reppuu Baxingar](https://anidb.net/anime/3116) (1982)

Part 2 of the J9 trilogy. Comes with even better music. The opening is *unbelievably* hype. Awful in just about every other aspect. 
At least it tries, and it tries hard. It really is a shame that Baxingar is just not that good of a show. There is so much gold but the execution was poor. 
Every death is telegraphed as soon as the character is introduced. There is no sense of time. I couldn't tell you if this anime took place over the course of 2 weeks or 2 years. 
I get that this is an old foreign cartoon with space motorcycles that grow enormous and then transform into a magical space robot. 
But I think it should still make sense within the world of Baxingar. All that said, I would be lying if I said I didn't like this a lot.
