## [Inside Mari](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/pwf9i37/boku-wa-mari-no-naka) (2012)

Read #2. It's been 7 years since the last time I read this, while it was releasing. This is a manga I remembered quite well. The knowledge of what's coming does not detract from the story, but certainly makes for a different read. Astonishingly pretty, and one of Oshimi's best.

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](https://anidb.net/anime/584) (1988)

Watch #2. What can I say? LOGH is perfection. I adore these characters.
