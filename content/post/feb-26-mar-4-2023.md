## [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) (1980)

Watch #2. Ideon is even better the second time around. Absolutely stelar. The opening song gives me such a high, but by the final episode I was in a bottomless pit of dread. My favorite robot anime. Beautiful work of art.

## [Space Runaway Ideon: Be Invoked](https://anidb.net/anime/1809) (1982)

Watch #2. I get chills just thinking about it. A masterpiece. What a wonderful conclusion to a harrowing story. Possibly the best animated film ever created.
