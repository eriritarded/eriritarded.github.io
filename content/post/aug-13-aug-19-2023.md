## [RideBack](https://anidb.net/anime/6235) (2009)

Astounding first episode, jumps off a steep cliff into a sea of mediocrity after. Nothing truly positive to say about this show outside of the premise and the first episode. Just went in a very poor direction. I could see this being good with twice the length and some competent writes, but even then it won't be good. Nothing particularly awful, but nothing too unique. No need for you to watch.

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars](https://anidb.net/anime/1307) (1988)

Watch #3. An astounding beginning to a marvelous series.

## [Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Overture to a New War](https://anidb.net/anime/1308) (1993)

Somehow missed this one on my first watch of the series. To nobody's surprise, this is amazing.
