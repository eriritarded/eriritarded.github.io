## [Super Dimension Century Orguss](https://anidb.net/anime/1039) (1983)

Honestly, I think I might like this one a bit more than Macross. I found the drama & romance to be significantly worse (what do you expect without Misa?), but overall I enjyed it. The sassy robots are hilarious. Gorgeous aerial fights. An extremely unique concept for a world, one I would have liked to explore much more. One of my favorite sci-fi aesthetics. the Groma/Gloma in particular is possibly my favorite "home base ship" that you see in sci-fi series.
