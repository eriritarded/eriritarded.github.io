## [Super Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross](https://anidb.net/anime/1177) (1984)

Lana. Lana Lana Lana Lana Lana. Lanaaaaaaaaaaa. I love Lana. Lana Lana Lana. Lana so cute. Lana is such a pretty name. Lana is so perfect. Lana. ARA ARA LANA. Lana are you looking to get married? Oh Lana, oh Lana. I have GOTTA get arrested by the military police. Please. Help me commit war crimes. Thanks.
Anyways. This anime seemed quite derivative. Seen most of the ideas in older mecha anime. Draws some from its older Super Dimensional Sister, Macross. Similar to [Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) in MANY ways, so much so that I'm convinced it's where the ideas came from. 
I had a lot to say while watching it. Now? Not much, just dissatisfaction. I did not get much out of this one. Started out good & the funny Squad 15 hijinks were good, but then a certain character was introduced. 
That guy sucks! Having a female protaganist in such an old mecha is nice, even if I didn't care much for her design or personality. The other characters were shallow. The plot? Just watch ideon. Or don't. 
It's not like they're the same exact shows, but Ideon did what I think Southern Cross tried to do so much better. Not to mention that Ideon was 2 years earlier. Funny how both MCs have afros!
