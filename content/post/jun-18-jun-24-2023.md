## [Techno Police 21C](https://anidb.net/anime/1862) (1982)

Most people seem to dislike this one but I enjoyed it for what it was. How could I ever complain about a high-quality remaster like this?

## [Living with A Succubus](https://anilist.co/manga/150052/Donggeonyeoga-Succubus/) (2022)

Shitty K-Porn manga. Only one reason to read this.

## [Crusher Joe OVA](https://anidb.net/anime/2057) (1988)

Just as fun and exciting as the movie. Please give us more Crusher Joe.

## [Poolside Playtime](https://anilist.co/manga/152440/Mulmitjageop/) (2022)

More generic, shitty Korean porn. The art in this one is quite nice.

## [Master, Please Charge Me](https://anilist.co/manga/162354/Juinnim-Chungjeonhae-Juseyo/) (2022)

Korean porn. Mildy entertaining subversion.

## [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Bakuen wo!](https://anidb.net/anime/16446} (2023)

This is no KonoSuba but it has some good moments.

## [Opapagoto](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/y4ghi5x/opapagoto) (2013)

I like the ideea, could've been good. Unfortunately the execution was mediocre and it got axed before it got a real chance. Pretty art.

## [Nobody](https://rateyourmusic.com/film/nobody_f3/) (2021)

Don't Call Saul.
