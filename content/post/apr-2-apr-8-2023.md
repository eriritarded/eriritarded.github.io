## [Ruin Explorers](https://anidb.net/anime/392) (1995)

Pretty fun, the early episodes are definitely better. I would love a long anime that's just nonstop chase scene hijinks.

## [Lawless](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212450/) (2012)

Nothing of note.

##[Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/5ghbmgn/kawaii-dake-ja-nai-shikimori-san) (2018)

Really liked this when it started. Not so much now.

## [Snuff Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckxtyYuU8QI) (2015)

Urbangarde song paired with a future KyoAni director? Count me the fuck in!

## [Urawa no Usagi-chan](https://anidb.net/anime/10879) (2015)

Not funny, not cute. Some of the girls have atrocious character designs.
