## [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anidb.net/anime/648) (1974)

Wow. Just wow. An absolute masterpiece. The most gorgeous TV anime I've ever seen, and possibly ever will. Sat there for five episodes straight staring with my mouth agape. Between the flawless animation and the modern remaster this looks perfect. Honestly I'm not even sure what words I could possibly use to do this justice. I am in awe. As these experiences with media get rarer and rarer I savor their flavor with an even greater intensity.
