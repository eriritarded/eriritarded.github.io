I honestly enjoyed this manga for must of the run. It's cute and funny, with good art, but the rushed ending felt a little flat. Hope to see Hiroyuki go back to something that leans into comedy more. Shino & Saki <3.

## [Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi] (2018)

Been reading since the start. Sad to see it end. Was always a cute little treat each month. There can never enough Yamamoto-sensei! Absolutely adorable!

## [Aura Battler Dunbine](https://anidb.net/anime/899) (1983)

Pretty interesting world with very boring characters. Actually scratch that I love CIELA LAPANA I love ELMELIE LUFT I love ELLE HUNM they are absolute royalty and I shall serve them. Bern Bunnings seems to be one of the more competent Tomino-blue-haired-antagonist characters. As far as Tomino shows go I thought this was definitely towards the lower half. The entire cast of the Zelana was bland as hell (sans Cham). However, as far as Tomino "final stretches" go this was one of the better ones.

<br>

While this is probably an inaccurate way of thinking, I see dunbine, L-Gaim, and Xabungle as a trilogy of sorts focusing on similar concepts and elements.

##  [Ponkotsu Ponko](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/cjr8xt7/useless-ponko) (2019)

Absolutely adorable & heartfelt manga. Every chapter thawed my frigid heart. It evokes a sense of love for the world and other living creatures that is difficult to find in myself or others. It makes me feel some form of nostalgia towards a type of unconditional, almost weightless love & acceptance for all. A far more hopeful outlook towards the world and others than I am capable of.

<br>

## [Chihayafuru](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/7tr007e/chihayafuru) (2007)

Reread the first 210 or so chapters and then finally finished it. Still amazing, but not quite the masterpiece I remembered. I just don't connect with romance stories anymore. I never got that anxious feeling when reading something impactful like I did the first time around.

## [Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan](https://anidb.net/anime/12112) (2016)

Watch #2. This entry is for the entire series. I just love these idiot characters. Hilarious.

## [Ruin Explorers](https://anidb.net/anime/392) (1995)

Pretty fun, the early episodes are definitely better. I would love a long anime that's just nonstop chase scene hijinks.

## [Didn`t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!](https://anidb.net/anime/13844) (2019)

As someone who's been a fan of the light novels since they first got licensed, everything I had seen had told me that this would be a terrible adaptation. How could I have been so wrong? This was an amazing adaptation! Less focus on pointless storylines, with more focuse on these funny. cute, comfy girls. I love it!

<br>

---

## [Super Dimension Century Orguss](https://anidb.net/anime/1039) (1983)

Honestly, I think I might like this one a bit more than Macross. I found the drama & romance to be significantly worse (what do you expect without Misa?), but overall I enjyed it. The sassy robots are hilarious. Gorgeous aerial fights. An extremely unique concept for a world, one I would have liked to explore much more. One of my favorite sci-fi aesthetics. the Groma/Gloma in particular is possibly my favorite "home base ship" that you see in sci-fi series.

<br>

---

## [Isekai Ojisan](https://anidb.net/anime/16389) (2022)

What an absolute treat. I figured there was no chance for the manga's art style to be adapted properly, but it managed to do that and more. A superb adaptation, even better than the manga. Hope for a season 2 but it seems unlikely considering the production troubles of this season.

<br>

---

## [The Idolmaster Movie: Kagayaki no Mukougawa e!](https://anidb.net/anime/9701) (2014)

The 45 minute drama arc seriously dragged this movie down. Lovely otherwise. There was this one rotoscoped scene that was so tasty to see. I found the casual clothes to be color coordinated extremely well.

<br>

## [Wizardy](https://anidb.net/anime/3133) (1991)

A few visually interesting shots, but overall quite forgettable.

## [Tatakae!! Iczer 1](https://anidb.net/anime/436) (1985)

Watch #2. So much fun and oh-so-pretty!

## [Silent Beach](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/qq5snuj/silent-beach) (1979)

Never thought I'd enjoy yaoi.

<br>

---

## [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anidb.net/anime/2357) (1982)

I really enjoyed this one. I'd put it somewhere in the middle as far as Tomino shows go. I particularly liked the comedy & mechanical designs. In some ways Xabungle feels like a proto L-Gaim, as many elements seem to be reused.

<br>

## [Platinum End](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/8db5z08/platina-end) (2015)

It's funny how bad this is.

# February 23

## [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) (1980)

Watch #2. Ideon is even better the second time around. Absolutely stelar. The opening song gives me such a high, but by the final episode I was in a bottomless pit of dread. My favorite robot anime. Beautiful work of art.


<br>

---

## [Space Runaway Ideon: Be Invoked](https://anidb.net/anime/1809) (1982)

Watch #2. I get chills just thinking about it. A masterpiece. What a wonderful conclusion to a harrowing story. Possibly the best animated film ever created.

<br>

## [Arion](https://anidb.net/anime/398) (1986)

Gorgeous film.


<br>

## [Project A-Ko: Final](https://anidb.net/anime/7686) (1989)

Worst of the four. Disappointing end to the series.

## [Aoi Umi no Tristia](https://anidb.net/anime/1664) (2004)

Nothing more than an advertisement for the visual novel.

## [THE IDOLM@STER](https://anidb.net/anime/8218) (2011)
Watch #2. Six years since the last time. Amazing show! Love these girls they are just so perfect and cute. 

<br>

---

## [THE IDOLM@STER: Shiny Festa](https://anidb.net/anime/9283) (2012)
Considering how good the series was, this was surprisingly awful. I was bored to death. How did this happen to my idols?

<br>

---

## [Hen Semi](https://anidb.net/anime/7431) (2010)

Went in blind. Once the shock of how weird it was got past me it was quite great. Looks like an old Shaft anime. Cute & funny.

<br>

## [Hen Semi](https://anidb.net/anime/8287) (2011)

A little bit worse than the OVA series, but still a fun watch.

## [Mobile Fighter G Gundam](https://anidb.net/anime/915) (1994)

Gundam super robots? Yes! Martial arts robot anime? Yes! Cutest Gundam girls to date? Yes! The mech designs are fun,  but I wish the story was a bit tighter.

<br>

# January 23


## [Project A-ko](https://anidb.net/anime/281) (1986)

So fucking weird. I don't know much about the guy, but I assume this must be Nishijima Katsuhiko's undiluted fantasy.

<br>

---

## [Futagotachi no Sho Jijou](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/h6menb0/futago-tachi-no-shojijou) (2020)

Just fine. Pretty art, but the characters have oddly shaped heads.

<br>

---

## [Back to the Kassan](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/4a8zcg1/back-to-the-kaasan) (2017)

Read #2. It's been about four years since I first read this and it is still one of the strangest pieces of art I have ever experienced. Not a week has gone by without me thinking about it. Interesting note, turns out the mangaka is also the guy who makes the exhibitionist armpit fetish manga.

<br>

---

## [Fashion](https://anidb.net/anime/9009) (1960)

Youji Kuri. His first work. I'm not a fan of this one, but it's worth watching just for it's place in history.

<br>

---

## [The Saga of Tanya the Evil - Vol. 11](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/youjo-senki/) (2019)

Soredemo Tanya wa Yosetekuru.

<br>

---

## [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anidb.net/anime/648) (1974)

Wow. Just wow. An absolute masterpiece. The most gorgeous TV anime I've ever seen, and possibly ever will. Sat there for five episodes straight staring with my mouth agape. Between the flawless animation and the modern remaster this looks perfect. Honestly I'm not even sure what words I could possibly use to do this justice. I am in awe. As these experiences with media get rarer and rarer I savor their flavor with an even greater intensity.

<br>

## [Karma](https://anidb.net/anime/14358) (1977)

Nobuhiro Aihara. Pretty lines, pretty sound.

<br>

## [Sensou no Tsukurikata](https://anidb.net/anime/11936) (2015)

Beautiful piece of art.

## [Toumei Ningen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZJFtdPy5_w) (1969)

Tatsuo Shimamura. Good, but odd.

## [Uchuu Majin Daikengo](https://anidb.net/anime/3151) (1978)
Once again surprised by how much I enjoy these old, forgotten robot shows. The story is fairly mediocre, however there are quite a few great episodes. The final act was awesome. Now for complaints. The show looks ugly as hell. There is no blood shown yet there is still death, which I find odd. The main girl has an extremely sexualized design, complete with a random wardrobe malfunction. So why no blood? Very odd. The mechanical designs didn't do much for me. Ryger's design rocked. Roboleon and Baracross had a hilarious relationship, probably my favorite aspect of Daikengo.

<br>

---

## [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/) (2022)
The movie is fine but I do not understand the extreme praise. It was /fine/. I just don't care. This doesn't speak to me.

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive](https://anidb.net/anime/14690) (2020)
Better than most isekai and most gacha game adaptations. Nice animation. Starts out average but picks up towards the end.

<br>

---

## [Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2](https://anidb.net/anime/15690) (2022)
Considering the first season started out as a shitty KonoSuba I am incredibly impressed with where it ended. The story is getting interesting. The animation is top notch. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and hope for more seasons.

## [Isekai Quartet: Another World](https://anidb.net/anime/15481) (2022)
Not a fan. Huge step down from the series in humor. The story was boring. Why did Vera need to be from Tanya's world? I was very bothered by the presentation of Tanya. As a huge fan of the novels, this Tanya is simply a different character.

Usually K-Porn manga sucks. This one was really fun.

---

## [Venus Senki](https://anidb.net/anime/620) (1989)
The plot is nothing special. But that's not why one watches this movie. One watches it because it's gorgeous. I adore the wonderfully animated mechanical gore.

## [Pokemon: Twilight Wings](https://anidb.net/anime/15309) (2020)
I played maybe 45 minutes of Pokemon in my life and I've watched no more than 5 episodes as a kid. But I had to watch this one because Nessa is just that cute. Giving me jungle fever. Fun, sweet, self contained-stories. Enjoyable & heartwarming.

## [Greed](https://anidb.net/anime/2493) (1985)
A very early OVA. All style no substance. Reminds me a lot of [Birth](https://anidb.net/anime/2640) (albeit not as cool) - the story is just a device to show some pretty visuals, a ton of chase scenes, and all the weird moving camera angles. I enjoyed it enough for what it was.

<br>

## [Akiba Meido Sensou](https://anidb.net/anime/17475) (2022)
 Surprisingly good for an anime about ganbanger maids.
 
<br>

---

## [Elf Princess Rane](https://anidb.net/anime/151) (1995)
Just plain awful. Utter dogshit. I assume this is a parody, because it is mind-numbingly stupid. In a very bad way. Not engaging in the slightest. The plot makes so little sense that I can't tell you anything that happened the whole hour. 
There's a character that says words backwards, and multiple occurrences of multiple characters talking over each other at a fast pace. 
There's good slapstick and there's bad slapstick. This is unequivocally the latter. I didn't even grin once. Worthless. I don't understand who the intended audience would have been.

## [Spy x Family Part 2](https://anidb.net/anime/17061) (2022)
Decent show. But why did they start naming anime like this? Please die.

## [Super Dimensional Cavalry Southern Cross](https://anidb.net/anime/1177) (1984)
<!--more-->

Lana. Lana Lana Lana Lana Lana. Lanaaaaaaaaaaa. I love Lana. Lana Lana Lana. Lana so cute. Lana is such a pretty name. Lana is so perfect. Lana. ARA ARA LANA. Lana are you looking to get married? Oh Lana, oh Lana. I have GOTTA get arrested by the military police. Please. Help me commit war crimes. Thanks.
Anyways. This anime seemed quite derivative. Seen most of the ideas in older mecha anime. Draws some from its older Super Dimensional Sister, Macross. Similar to [Ideon](https://anidb.net/anime/1807) in MANY ways, so much so that I'm convinced it's where the ideas came from. 
I had a lot to say while watching it. Now? Not much, just dissatisfaction. I did not get much out of this one. Started out good & the funny Squad 15 hijinks were good, but then a certain character was introduced. 
That guy sucks! MC-chan was pretty great, most of the other characters were shallow (including my dear Lana). The plot? Just watch ideon. Or don't. 
It's not like they're the same exact shows, they really aren't, not at all, not even close. **But...** But... But... Ideon did what I think Southern Cross tried to do so much better. Not to mention that Ideon was 2 years earlier. Funny how both MCs have afros! 

<br>

## [Ginga Reppuu Baxingar](https://anidb.net/anime/3116) (1982)
<!--more-->
Part 2 of the J9 trilogy. Comes with even better music. The opening is *unbelievably* hype. Awful in just about every other aspect. 
At least it tries, and it tries hard. It really is a shame that Baxingar is just not that good of a show. There is so much gold but the execution was poor. 
Every death is telegraphed as soon as the character is introduced. There is no sense of time. I couldn't tell you if this anime took place over the course of 2 weeks or 2 years. 
I get that this is an old foreign cartoon with space motorcycles that grow enormous and then transform into a magical space robot. 
But I think it should still make sense within the world of Baxingar. All that said, I would be lying if I said I didn't like this a lot.

Have you ever heard of J9? People say they used to run amok through the Solar System long ago. And this world we're in has gone to ruin. If you're careless you'll get whacked from behind. Bad then and it's bad now! Same as it ever was!
Very poor pacing, but I still enjoyed it.

I find it amusing how Japan does the female-teacher-predator-pedophile-but-she's-actually-just-a-maiden-so-there's-nothing-wrong trope.

## [Falling Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884831/) (1993)
My favorite type of movie. Love watching unhinged men (optional) go on a rampage. Absolutely hilarious!
