## [Aharan-san wa Hakarenai](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/pg9rv0p/aharen-san-wa-hakarenai) (2017)

Managed to stay consistently good the entire run, and didn't make me cringe as I got older. Cute ending.

The age makes this interesting & impressive. Unfortunately, it does not make it good or engaging. Worth watching solely for the historical value.
